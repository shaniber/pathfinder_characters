    Feats
    -----
        Channeled Shield Wall 
            Description:
                You draw upon your channel energy to enhance the protective 
                ability of your shield and those of allies while they are 
                adjacent to you. 
            Benefit:
                As a swift action, you can spend a use of your channel energy 
                to grant yourself a +2 deflection bonus while using a shield. 
                This bonus lasts 1 minute per cleric level or effective cleric 
                level. While you benefit from this bonus, allies with shields 
                also gain a +2 deflection bonus while they are adjacent to you.
        Channeling Force 
            Description:
                You distill your channeled energy into a sheen of force that 
                surrounds your weapon for a limited time.
            Benefit:
                A swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to 
                grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to the 
                number of dice of your channel energy. This extra damage is 
                force damage. This lasts for your next three weapon attacks or 
                until the end of combat, whichever comes first.
        Channel Smite 
            Description:
                You can channel your divine energy through your weapon. 
            Benefit:
                Before you make a melee attack roll, you can choose to spend 
                one use of your channel energy ability as a swift action. If 
                you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, 
                that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the 
                damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you 
                channel negative energy and you hit a living creature, that 
                creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the 
                damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability. Your 
                target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this 
                additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy 
                ability is still expended with no effect. 
        Deflect Arrows (Granted)
            Description:
                You can know arrows and other projectiles off course, 
                preventing them from hitting you. Provided by Quick Block
                Buckler
            Benefit:
                You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use 
                this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with 
                an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you 
                take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not 
                flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't 
                count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as 
                boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by 
                natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected. 
        Divine Protection 
            Description:
                Your deity protects you against deadly attacks. 
            Benefit:
                Once per day as an immediate action before rolling a saving 
                throw, you can add your Charisma modifier on that saving throw. 
                As usual, this does not stack if you already apply your 
                Charisma modifier to that saving throw. If you possess the 
                charmed life class feature, you can instead apply Divine 
                Protection's bonus after rolling the saving throw but before 
                the result is revealed. 
        Extra Channel 
            Description:
                You can channel divine energy more often. 
            Benefit:
                You can channel energy two additional times per day. 
        Guided Hand 
            Description:
                Your deity blesses any strike you make with that deity's favored 
                weapon. 
            Benefit:
                With your deity's favored weapon, you can use your Wisdom 
                modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier on 
                attack rolls. 
        Improved Channel 
            Description:
                Your channeled energy is harder to resist. 
            Benefit:
                Add 2 to the DC of saving throws made to resist the effects of 
                your channel energy ability. 
        Quick Channel 
            Description:
                Your divine energies flash with dazzling speed. 
            Benefit:
                You may channel energy as a move action by spending 2 daily 
                uses of that ability. 
        Selective Channeling 
            Description:
                You can choose whom to affect when you channel energy. 
            Benefit:
                When you channel energy, you can choose 4 targets in the area. 
                These targets are not affected by your channeled energy. 
    Special Attacks
    ---------------
        Chains of Justice (Su) 
            Once per day, you can bind an opponent within 60 feet to you 
            with spectral chains (Will DC 23 negates). When you take 
            damage from an enemy, the bound target takes this damage as 
            well. Whenever the bound target takes damage from you or one 
            of your allies, you take this damage as well. You and the 
            target are not physically bound to each other, and either can 
            end the connection by breaking the line of effect or 
            exceeding the ability's range. You may dismiss the chains as 
            a standard action.
        Channel Positive Energy (Su)
            You can unleash a wave of positive energy. You must choose to 
            deal 8d6 points of positive energy damage to undead creatures 
            or to heal living creatures of 8d6 points of damage. Creatures 
            that take damage from channeled energy receive a DC 23 Will 
            save to halve the damage. You can use this ability 9 times per 
            day.
        Judicious Force (Su) 
            If you or an ally within 10 feet makes a critical threat with a 
            melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you may add +4 
            to the confirmation roll. This does not stack with the Critical 
            Focus feat. You may use this ability 9 times per day.
        Sneak Attack (Ex)
            If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend 
            himself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital 
            spot for extra damage. Your attack deals 1d6 points of extra 
            damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus 
            to AC, or when you flank your target. Should you score a 
            critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not 
            multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if 
            the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals 
            nonlethal damage, you can make a sneak attack that deals 
            nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a 
            weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in 
            a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. You must be 
            able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and 
            must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack 
            while striking a creature with concealment.
    Special Qualities
    -----------------
        Aura (Ex)  
            A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a 
            particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment 
            (see the detect evil spell for details). 
        Aura of Chaos (Ex)  
            You project an overwhelming chaotic aura. 
        Aura of Good (Ex)  
            You project an overwhelming good aura. 
        Bit of Luck (Sp)  
            You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, giving it a 
            bit of luck. For the next round, any time the target rolls a d20, 
            he may roll twice and take the more favorable result. You can use 
            this ability 9 times per day. 
        Camouflaged Step (Ex)  
            Skulks can pass through forest and subterranean settings almost 
            without a trace. Add +10 to the DC to track a skulk in these 
            environments. 
        Chameleon Skin (Ex)  
            A skulk's racial bonus to Stealth comes from his ability to change 
            the color of his skin to match his surroundings, even complex or 
            regular patterns like bricks and mortar. A skulk loses this 
            conditional bonus if he is wearing armor, or if he wears any 
            clothing that covers more than one-quarter of his body, as skulks 
            can only change their own flesh, not things they carry. A skulk 
            normally conceals small items behind his body; by putting his back 
            to a wall and changing his front half, he can hide the item 
            because observers don't have line of sight to the item. 
        Compression (Ex)
            The creature can move through an area as small as one-quarter its 
            space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.
        Good Fortune (Ex)  
            As an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you 
            have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You 
            must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the 
            original roll. You can use this ability 2 times per day. 
        Low-Light Vision (Ex)  
            You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters 
            with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light 
            that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light 
            Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can 
            read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to 
            her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see 
            outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day. 
        Orisons  
            You can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These 
            spells are cast like any other spells, but they are not expended 
            when used and may be used again. 
        Spontaneous Casting  
            You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you 
            did not prepare ahead of time. You can "lose" any prepared spell 
            that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure 
            spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell 
            with "Cure" in its name).

    Details
    -------
        Sacred Adamantium Starknife +2
            Believed to be a gift from the Goddess Desna to her odd subject 
            Malk, this adamantium starknife grants a +2 bonus to hit and damage
            rolls, as well as a +2 sacred bonus to AC. Being adamantium, this
            weapon also ignores up to 20 points of hardness.
        Headband of Mental Prowess (Wis/Cha) +4
            This simple copper headband has a small yellow gem set so that 
            when it rests upon the forehead of the wearer, the yellow gem 
            sits perched on the wearer's brow as if it were a third eye in 
            the middle of his forehead. Often, the headband contains 
            additional designs to further accentuate the appearance of a 
            third, crystal eye.
            The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to two mental 
            ability scores (Wisdom and Charisma) of +4. Treat this as 
            a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is 
            worn. These bonuses are chosen when the headband is created and 
            cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, 
            it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence.
        Amulet of Natural Armor +3
            This amulet, usually containing some type of magically preserved
            monster hide or other natural armor - such as bone, horn, carapace,
            or beast scales - toughens the wearer's body and flesh, giving him 
            an enhancement bonus to his natural armor of +3.
        Bracers of Armor
            These items appear to be wrist or arm guards, sometimes etched 
            with symbols of protection or depictions of vigilant-looking 
            animals.
            Bracers of armor surround the wearer with an invisible but 
            tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +3, just 
            as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for 
            the magic to be effective.
        Ring of Protection +3
            This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a 
            deflection bonus of +3 to AC.
        Belt of the Weasel
            This surprisingly soft belt has an absurdly large buckle, made 
            even more absurd by the fact that it's crafted in the shape of a 
            smiling weasel's face.
            It grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and the 
            ability to move at half normal speed while prone. Treat the 
            enhancement bonus to Dexterity as a temporary ability bonus for 
            the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not take a 
            penalty on melee attack rolls or to AC against melee attacks while 
            prone. Additionally, the wearer gains the compression ability.
        Cloak of Resistance +4
            Flecks of silver or steel are often sown amid the fabric of these 
            magical cloaks. This garment offers magic protection in the form 
            of a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, 
            and Will).
        Boots of Elvenkind
            These soft boots are partially made out of living leaves and other 
            natural materials.
            They enable the wearer to move nimbly about in virtually any 
            surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.
        Quick Block Buckler
            Once per round as an immediate action, this +3 arrow deflection 
            Buckler can be used to block an incoming melee attack. When used 
            in this way, the Buckler's enhancement bonus increases by +2 
            against that attack. The Buckler's user must decide to use this 
            ability before the attack roll is made. When the shield's user 
            blocks a melee attack in this way, it cannot use its arrow 
            deflection special ability for 1 round.
        Bag of Holding 
            This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in 
            size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its 
            inside is larger than its outside dimensions.
            Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. 
            This particular bag weighs 15 lbs., can hold 250 lbs. or 30 cubic 
            ft. of material.
    Misc (not abilities)
    --------------------
        Aid Another
            In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If youâ€™re in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponentâ€™s next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.
            You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or to assist another characterâ€™s skill check.
