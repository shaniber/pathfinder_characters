	Feats
	-----
		Combat Casting
			You get a +4 bonus on concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a 
			spell-like ability when casting on the defensive or while grappled.
	  
		Craft Magic Arms and Armor
			You can create magic weapons, armor, or shields. Enhancing a weapon, suit 
			of armor, or shield takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its 
			magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must 
			use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See the magic item 
			creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. The weapon, armor, or 
			shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost 
			is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, 
			suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs 
			half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item 
			in the first place.
	  
		Empower Spell
			All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half 
			including bonuses to those dice rolls. Saving throws and opposed rolls are 
			not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell 
			uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

		Eschew Materials 
			You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without 
			needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of 
			opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs 
			more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the 
			spell, as normal. 
	  
		Great Fortitude
			You get a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws.

		Improved Initiative
			You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

		Lightning Reflexes
			You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.

		Magical Aptitude
			You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks. If 
			you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 
			for that skill.
	  
		Minor Spell Expertise
			You may cast Magic Missle twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster 
			level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class 
			from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is 
			Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it 
			may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this 
			spell.

		Selective Spell
			When casting a selective spell with an area effect and a duration of 
			instantaneous, you can choose a number of targets in the area equal to the 
			ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type 
			(Charisma for bards, oracles, paladins, sorcerers, and summoners; Intelligence 
			for witches and wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, inquisitors, and rangers). 
			These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. A selective spell 
			uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. Spells 
			that do not have an area of effect do not benefit from this feat.
		
		Skill Focus (Spellcraft)
			You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving Spellcraft. If you have 10 or more 
			ranks in Spellcraft, this bonus increases to +6.
		
	Traits
	------
		Dangerously Curious
			You have always been intrigued by magic, possibly because you were the child of 
			a magician or priest. You often snuck into your parent's laboratory or shrine 
			to tinker with spell components and magic devices, and often caused quite a bit 
			of damage and headaches for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 trait bonus 
			on Use Magic Device checks, and Use Magic Device is always a class skill for you.

		Poverty-Stricken
			Your childhood was tough, and your parents had to make every copper piece count. 
			Hunger was your constant companion, and you often had to live off the land or 
			sleep in the wild. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks, and Survival 
			is always a class skill for you.

	Special Qualities
	-----------------
		Bloodline Arcana
			Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of 
			damage to fire. This also changes the spell's type to Fire.

		Cantrips
			You learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like 
			any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.

		Defensive Training (Ex)
			Gnomes get a +4 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the giant type.

		Elemental Bloodline (Fire)
			The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can hardly control its 
			fury.	This influence comes from an elemental outsider in your family history or 
			a time when you or your relatives were exposed to a powerful elemental force.

		Gnome Magic (Sp)
			Gnomes add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against illusion spells that they 
			cast. Gnomes with a Charisma of 11 or higher also gain spell-like abilities.

		Hatred (Ex)
			Gnomes receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the 
			reptilian and goblinoid subtypes due to special training against these hated 
			foes.

		Illusion Resistance (Ex)
			Gnomes get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against illusion spells or effects.

		Keen Senses (Ex)
			Gnomes receive a +2 bonus on Perception skill checks.

		Low-Light Vision (Ex)
			You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light 
			vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far 
			as normal in   light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with 
			low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is 
			next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see 
			outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

		Obsessive (Ex)
			Gnomes receive a +2 racial bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of their choice.

		Resistance to Fire (Ex)
			You may ignore 20 points of Fire damage each time you take fire damage.

		Weapon Familiarity (Ex)
			Gnomes treat any weapon with the word "gnome" in its name as a martial weapon.

	Background
		Lighthouse is a gnomish sorcerer, about 29 years old. He doesn't remember much before his 21st year, though. His first real memory is of a half-Orc woman hauling him away from the ruins of the old lighthouse, and pain in his shattered hips.

		He spent the majority of the next year healing, hiding in the same ruins and surviving on the berries and hunted meat that the half-Orc brought him from the surrounding forest. he eventually gained some mobility back, and was able to hobble slowly around town leaning heavily on a walking stick. His magical abilities manifested early, starting with the ability to set small fires to keep him and the half-Orc warm in the winter.

		The half-Orc became his constant companion. Carting him on her back, she was not only his best means of transportation, but his protector. When with him, the half-Orc was generally pacifist, unless the gnome was threatened. Then the spiked gauntlet that she wore would rarely miss.

		Together, they became known as "that Lighthouse Kid and his Thug". Since he couldn't remember his name, and she couldn't communicate beyond a handful of grunts and half-words, the names stuck.

		Lately, Lighthouse has been bitten by a bug to adventure. He's talked with other sorcerers passing through, when they would give him the time of day, and has given himself a runic tattoo. With the little bit of coin that they've managed to scrape together, they've purchased some basic adventuring gear, and they're ready to make a name for themselves.  He joined a group, the Company of Unfortunate Allies, as they were drafted into service to discover the source of power of the Runelords.

		Lighthouse currently has been buying up property in towns around the countryside.  He currently owns a small house in Sandpoint, just by the old lighthouse, and a townhouse, appropriated from Judge Ironside, in Magnamar.  

		Currently, a lawyer in Magnamar has a 1,000 gp retainer to pay a footman to maintain the houses, and pay for any repairs.

		Lighthouse was killed while exploring the Runeforge, his soul judged by Pharasma to be worthy of Nirvana. His soul was restless, however, and still ready for adventure. While there, he fought with Saranrae's generals to repel an attack by Eiseth and her army. This did not slake his wanderlust, though, and when he felt the pull of a resurrection from his compatriates from the Company, he returned to his body eagerly.
