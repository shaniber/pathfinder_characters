			SR: No; see text	
			Effect: This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from
				mental control, and from summoned creatures.	It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

				First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

				Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person, command, and dominate person. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.

				Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
			Target: Creature touched

		Shield (Abjuration)
			Saves: 	
			DC: 	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 4 minutes [D]	
			Range: Personal	
			Components: V, S
			SR: 	
			Effect: Shield creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front 
				of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk also
				provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal
				ouch attacks, since it is a force effect. The shield has no armor
				check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
			Target: You

		Burning Hands (Evocation)
			Saves: Reflex half	
			DC: 16	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: Instantaneous	
			Range: 15 ft.	
			Components: V, S
			SR: Yes	
			Effect: A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips dealing 4d4 
				points of fire damage to any creature in the effect area.

	Sorcerer Spells - Level 2
	-------------------------
		Continual Flame (Evocation)
			Saves: none	
			DC: 		
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: Permanent	
			Range: Object Touched	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: no
			Effect: A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an 
				object that you touch.

		Flaming Sphere (Evocation)
			Saves: Reflex negates	
			DC: 18
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 1/lvl	
			Range: Med (150')	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: no
			Effect: A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and
				burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this
				movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it
				enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 
				3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex 
				save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 
				4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates 
				the same area as a torch would.

				The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for 
				you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be 
				extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. 
				The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does
				not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling 
				creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if 
				it exceeds the spell's range.

				points of fire damage.
