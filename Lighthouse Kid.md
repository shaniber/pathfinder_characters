FEATS
-----
	Combat Casting
	  You get a +4 bonus on concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when casting on the defensive or while grappled.
  
	Craft Magic Arms and Armor
		You can create magic weapons, armor, or shields. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
  
	Empower Spell
		All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half including bonuses to those dice rolls. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
  
	Improved Initiative
		You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.
  
	Skill Focus (Spellcraft)
	Simple Weapon Proficiency
	Eschew Materials

		Protection from Evil (Abjuration)
			Saves: Will negates (harmless)	
			DC: 16	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 8 minutes [D]
			Range: Touch	
			Components: V, S, M/DF
			SR: No; see text	
			Effect: This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, 
				from mental control, and from summoned creatures.	It creates a 
				magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The 
				barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

				First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 
				resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against 
				attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

				Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw 
				(if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or 
				effects that possess or exercise mental control over the 
				creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and 
				enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person,
				command, and dominate person. This saving throw is made with 
				a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. 
				If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration 
				of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this 
				spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the 
				target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise 
				mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a 
				controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using 
				magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the 
				target. This second effect only functions against spells and 
				effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM 
				discretion.

				Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned 
				creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such 
				creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such
				attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned 
				creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The 
				protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the 
				warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force 
				the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance
				can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch 
				the warded creature.
			Target: Creature touched

		Shield (Abjuration)
			Saves: none
			DC: 	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 7 minutes [D]	
			Range: Personal	
			Components: V, S
			SR: 	
			Effect: Shield creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in 
				front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. 
				The	disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus 
				applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The shield has no armor	check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
			Target: You

  
	Sorcerer Spells - Level 2
	-------------------------
		Continual Flame (Evocation)
			Saves: none	
			DC: 		
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: Permanent	
			Range: Object Touched

				ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain 
				temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum

		Flaming Sphere (Evocation)
			Saves: Reflex negates	
			DC: 18
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 8 rounds	
			Range: Med (180')	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: no
			Effect: A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you 
				point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As 
				part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to 
				strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops 
				moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that 
				creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A 
				flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It 
				ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates 
				the same area as a torch would.

				The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move 
				action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. 
				It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal 
				fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, 
				yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its 
				flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down 
				large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the 
				spell's range.

				each dealing 4d6 points of fire damage.

	Sorcerer Spells - Level 4
	-------------------------
		Fire Shield
			Saves: None
			DC: 
			Casting: 1 standard Action
			Duration: 8 rounds
			Range: Personal
			Componends: V, S, M
			SR: 
			Effect: This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each
			 	creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you 
			 	from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if 
			 	you choose cool or warm flames for your fire shield.

				Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon 
				deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 
				points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This 
				damage is either cold damage (if you choose a chill shield) or 
				fire damage (if you choose a warm shield). If the attacker has 
				spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding 
				melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they 
				attack you.

				When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but 
				the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 
				10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames 
				is blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or red if 
				the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version 
				are as follows.
