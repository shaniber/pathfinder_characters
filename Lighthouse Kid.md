	Feats
	-----
		Combat Casting
			You get a +4 bonus on concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when casting on the defensive or while grappled.
	  
		Craft Magic Arms and Armor
			You can create magic weapons, armor, or shields. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
	  
		Empower Spell
			All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half including bonuses to those dice rolls. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

		Eschew Materials 
			You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal. 
	  
		Improved Initiative
			You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

		Lightning Reflexes
			You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.

		Magical Aptitude
			You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.
	  
		Minor Spell Expertise
			You may cast Magic Missle twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

		Skill Focus (Spellcraft)
		
		Simple Weapon Proficiency
		
		Eschew Materials

		Resistance to Fire
			You may ignore 20 points of fire damage each time you take fire damage

	Background
		Lighthouse is a gnomish sorcerer, about 29 years old. He doesn't remember much before his 21st year, though. His first real memory is of a half-Orc woman hauling him away from the ruins of the old lighthouse, and pain in his shattered hips.

		He spent the majority of the next year healing, hiding in the same ruins and surviving on the berries and hunted meat that the half-Orc brought him from the surrounding forest. he eventually gained some mobility back, and was able to hobble slowly around town leaning heavily on a walking stick. His magical abilities manifested early, starting with the ability to set small fires to keep him and the half-Orc warm in the winter.

		The half-Orc became his constant companion. Carting him on her back, she was not only his best means of transportation, but his protector. When with him, the half-Orc was generally pacifist, unless the gnome was threatened. Then the spiked gauntlet that she wore would rarely miss.

		Together, they became known as "the Lighthouse Kid and his Thug". Since he couldn't remember his name, and she couldn't communicate beyond a handful of grunts and half-words, the names stuck.

		Lately, Lighthouse has been bitten by a bug to adventure. He's talked with other sorcerers passing through, when they would give him the time of day, and has given himself a runic tattoo. With the little bit of coin that they've managed to scrape together, they've purchased some basic adventuring gear, and they're ready to make a name for themselves.

		Lighthouse currently has been buying up property in towns around the countryside.  He currently owns a small house in Sandpoint, just by the old lighthouse, and a townhouse, appropriated from Judge Ironside, in Magnamar.  

		Currently, a lawyer in Magnamar has a 1,000 gp retainer to pay a footman to maintain the houses, and pay for any repairs.

		Protection from Evil (Abjuration)
			Saves: Will negates (harmless)	
			DC: 19	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 11 minutes [D]
			Range: Touch	
			Components: V, S, M/DF
			SR: No; see text	
			Effect: 
				This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures.	It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

				First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

				Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person, command, and dominate person. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.

				Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
			Target: Creature touched

		Shield (Abjuration)
			Saves: none
			DC: 	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 11 minutes [D]	
			Range: Personal	
			Components: V, S
			SR: 	
			Effect: 
				Shield creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
			Target: You

  
	Sorcerer Spells - Level 2
	-------------------------
		Continual Flame (Evocation)
			Saves: none	
			DC: 		
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: Permanent	
			Range: Object Touched	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: no
			Effect: 
				A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch.

		False Life (Necromancy)
			Saves: 	
			DC: 	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 11 hours or until discharged; see text	
			Range: Personal	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: 	
			Effect: 
				You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).
			Target: You

		Flaming Sphere (Evocation)
			Saves: Reflex negates	
			DC: 20
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 11 rounds	
			Range: Med (190')	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: yes
			Effect: 
				A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

				The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

		Pyrotechnics (Transmutation, Fire)
			Saves: Will negates or Fortitude negates; see text; 
			DC: 20
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave the smoke cloud; see text	
			Range: Long (760 ft.)	
			Components: V, S, M
			SR: Yes or No; see text	
			Effect: 
				Pyrotechnics turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice.

				Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness.

				Smoke Cloud: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.
			Target: One fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube

		Scorching Ray (Evocation)
			Saves: None	
			DC: 	
			Casting: 1 standard action
			Duration: Instantaneous	
			Range: Close (55 ft.)

		Fire Shield
			Saves: None
			DC: 
			Casting: 1 standard Action
			Duration: 11 rounds
			Range: Personal
			Componends: V, S, M
			SR: 
			Effect: 
				This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your fire shield.

				Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if you choose a chill shield) or fire damage (if you choose a warm shield). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

				When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or red if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.

	Sorcerer Spells - Level 6
	-------------------------
		Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)
			Saves: None	
			DC: 	
			Time: 1 standard action
			Duration: 12 rounds	
			Range: 10 ft.	
			Comp: V, S, M
			SR: No	
			Effect: 
				An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 4rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 5th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a dispel magic spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

				Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

				If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.	
			Target: 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you
