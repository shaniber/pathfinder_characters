	Feats
	-----
		Channel Smite
			Description:
				You can channel your divine energy through your weapon.
			Benefit:
				Before you make a melee attack roll, you can choose to spend one use of your channel energy ability as a swift action. If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still expended with no effect.
		  
		Combat Casting
			Description:
				You are adept at spellcasting when threatened or distracted.
			Benefit:
				You get a +4 bonus on concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when casting on the defensive or while grappled.
		  
		Extra Channel
			Description:
				You can channel divine energy more often.
			Benefit:	  
				You can channel energy two additional times per day.

		Improved Channel
			Description:
				Your channeled energy is harder to resist.
			Benefit:
				Add 2 to the DC of saving throws made to resist the effects of your channel energy ability. 

		Improved Initiative
			Description:
				Your quick reflexes allow you to react quickly to danger.
			Benefit:
				You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

		Lightning Reflexes
			Description:
				You have faster reflexes than normal.
			Benefit:
				You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.

		Skill Focus (Perception)
			Description:
				You are particularly adept at your chosen skill.
			Benefit:
				You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving Perception. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +6.

		Turn Undead
			Description:
				Calling upon higher powers, you cause undead to flee from the might of your unleashed divine energy.
			Benefit:
				You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if panicked. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).

	Traits
	------
		Adopted
			Description:
				You were adopted and raised by someone not of your race, and raised in a society not your own.
			Benefit:
				As a result, you picked up a race trait from your adoptive parents and society, and may immediately select a race trait from your adoptive parents' race.
		Freedom Fighter
			Description:
				Youâ€™ve dedicated your life to fighting against oppression, tyranny, and slavery.
			Benefit:
				You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls against slavers or any creature holding someone against their will.
		Undead Slayer (Pharasma)
			Description:
				Instructed at a young age in the tenets of the faith of the Goddess of Souls, you view the undead as abominations that must be destroyed so their souls can journey beyond to be judged.
			Benefit:
				You gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls against undead.

	Special Qualities
	-----------------
		Adaptability
			Half-elves receive Skill Focus as a bonus feat at 1st level.

		Aura
			Has as a particularly powerful Neutral (which is to say, no aura).

		Bonus Spell Penetration (Outsiders) (2x)
			Add +1 on caster level checks made to overcome the spell resistance of outsiders.

		Death's Embrace
			You heal damage instead of taking damage from channeled negative energy. If the channeled negative energy targets undead, you heal hit points just like undead in the area. 

		Elf Blood
			Half-elves count as both elves and humans for any effect related to race. 

		Elven Immunities
			Half-elves are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects. 

		Keen Senses
			Half-elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.

		Low-Light Vision
			You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day. 

		Multitalented
			Half-elves choose two favored classes at first level and gain +1 hit point or +1 skill point whenever they take a level in either one of those classes. 

		Orisons
			You can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they are not expended when used and may be used again. 

		Spontaneous Casting
			You can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that you did not prepare ahead of time. You can "lose" any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "Cure" in its name). 

		Touch the Spirit World
			With a touch, you can empower a weapon to affect incorporeal creatures. The weapon touched deals half damage to incorporeal creatures, or full damage if it is a magic weapon. This benefit lasts for 13 rounds. You can use this ability 6 times per day. 

		Ward Against Death
			You can emit a 30-foot aura that wards against death for 13 rounds per day. Living creatures in this area are immune to death effects, energy drain, and effects that cause negative levels. This ward does not remove negative levels that a creature has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while the creature is inside the warded area. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

	Background:
	A half-elf cleric of Pharasma. As a child, their family was part of a commune of elves, humans, and half-elves that worshiped Pharasma. The commune was over-run by orcs when they were travelling through the mountains, their parent's were killed, and they were neutered by an axe blow and left for dead. They spent several weeks living amongst the dead of their commune, until they were rescued by a band of halfling rangers that had been tracking the orcs.  The band took Carobadanten, and together the group rescued the remains of the commune, while slaughtering who the orcs. The band adopted Carobadanten, and the remainder of the commune, and they continued their family's work with the halflings.

	After travelling with the band of halflings for many years, the group settled, starting a small village in the hills near Magnamar. Carobadanten left, still feeling the urge to travel and adventure.  They still attempted to travel back to the village regularly to visit their adopted clan and the remainder of the clerics from the original commune.

	During one expedition, Carobadanten stumbled upon the entrance to the Runeforge completely by chance, after accidentally creating a small crack in the fabric of time and space. Very quickly, they walked through a patch of green fog, which caused a terrible transformation into a large goldfish.
